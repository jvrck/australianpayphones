# Australian Payphones

This package no longer functions properly because Telstra has changed the map service used to get payphone data.

The service needs to be updated to use a selection of new Telstra services.

For historical payphone data, [visit the data repo](https://github.com/jvrck-data/aus-payphones-data/tree/master/data).
